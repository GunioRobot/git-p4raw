 - the change_parents table has a horrid denormalised JSON dump of
   impedence mismatches that is never recalculated unless you delete
   the change_parents row.

   Upon reflection, I think the only information I need to keep there
   to regenerate the merge conflict is the merge base, so I'll do away
   with that horrid beast first.

 - there are several queries which I wrote before I discovered SELECT
   DISTINCT ON (column, column) that should be rewritten (I discovered
   this perhaps a few days ago!).  In particular the views, defined in
   constraints.sql, use stupid NOT EXISTS () subqueries.  These must go.

 - No clean-up of the commit message from the information embedded in
   the Perl perforce repository is yet performed.  Need to extract the
   author information and change the Author field of the commit.  This
   is not a TODO for the general tool; people may just customise the
   make_commit() function for their site.
